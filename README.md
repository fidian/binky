Binky
=====

Binky is an email autoresponder.  You send it a message and it replies.  Typically this is for getting web pages.

Binky requires a server that has perl installed and a few modules.  It's been a very long time since Binky was alive.  It could be terribly difficult to resuscitate this piece of software, but you are certainly welcome to try.
