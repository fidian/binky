<h1 align=center>Requirements to Run Binky</h1>

<dl>

<dt>PERL - <a href="http://www.perl.org/">http://www.perl.org/</a>
<dd>This is the language Binky is written in, so you gotta have it.  Binky
also requires some <a href="perl_modules.html">PERL Modules</a> to be
installed on the system.

<dt>A web server - This can be a separate machine
<dd>Binky is configured only through a web-based interface.  Please note
that the web server must be able to run PERL files, but it only needs <a
href="perl_modules.html">a few modules</a>.  The web server must be able to
run PERL scripts as CGI files.  [<a href="web_server.html">More Info ...</a>]

<dt>A database - This can be yet another machine
<dd>Binky's configuration, logs, and everything else is stored in a database
whenever possible.  I use MySQL, but I bet that Binky can be ran with nearly
any other sort of database.
