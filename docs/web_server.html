<h1 align=center>Web Server Information</h1>

<p>First off, the web server must have PERL and a few <a
href="perl_modules.html">modules</a> on it for the web-based administration
to work properly.  Secondly, it must be configured to execute .pl files as
CGI scripts.  Lastly, you probably want to password protect the directory.</p>

<p>In the /etc/apache/access.conf (or wherever the access.conf file is),
just make sure to have "ExecCGI" listed on the "Options" line.  You might
have to add a section that specifies Binky's home directory explicitly to
override the default settings for users.</p>

<p>Edit the srm.conf file in the same directory and add "AddHandler
cgi-script .pl" to it (you should see a section about CGI scripts in
there).  Lastly, edit httpd.conf and make sure you have the CGI module 
loaded.</p>

<p>Change to Binky's installation directory and rename 'webadmin' to
'public_html' (or whatever the server thinks is the user's web directory.
Read the Apache documentation about .htaccess files and how you can restrict
access to this directory.

<p>This won't make PERL run blazingly fast, but it should be good enough for
administration of Binky.  Read more about mod_perl and other tweaks that you
can do to the server to make it faster when interpreting PERL if you plan on
using more PERL scripts on your server.
